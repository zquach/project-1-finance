Data Analysis Project 1 - Finance (Team 4)

Background:

Do you know when the next pandemic might hit? What should we do if we’ve invested hundreds of dollars in the stock market? Should we hold onto our shares or consider selling immediately?

In this project, we analyzed three datasets covering both stocks and cryptocurrencies, spanning from 2014 to the present. Each dataset includes daily open, close, high, and low prices for all stocks and cryptos. To assess the impact of COVID-19, one of the most significant pandemics of the 21st century, we’ll focus on six assets—two cryptocurrencies, two biotech stocks, and two tech stocks—and examine their performance before, during, and after the pandemic.

Instructions:
1. Prepare the data
2. Generate dataframes for crypto and stocks. 
3. Remove and rename columns
4. Merge the dataframes together
5. Create graphs to review trends
